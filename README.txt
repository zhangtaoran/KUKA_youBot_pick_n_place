This is Taoran Zhang's 449 final project.

One of the folder is named 'code', which contains the basic fullprogram of the project and a txt version of it as required.

The other is named results, which contains cases of 3 different controller behaviors. To run each case, just run best.py, overshoot.py and newTask.py respectively.
